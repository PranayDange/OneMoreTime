Describe what is cloud computing
..delivery model for services like -storage(files,databases),Compute Power,Networking,Analytics and more services.

Compute Power
Once data is in cloud you need compute power resources like(windows vm,linux,web containers,.or any other)
Once you have your compute power you need to connect them securely.

Describe terms such as
.High Availability
.Scalability
.Elasticity
.Agility
.Fault Tolerance
.Disaster Recovery

Scalability
Scalability is the ability to scale
Scaling is a process of

+ allocating(adding) or
+ deallocating(removing)
+ resources

Elasticity
+ Elasticity is the ability to scale dynamically
+ User load changes as the day changes

Agility
Agility the ability to reach quickly
In cloud there are two provisions the resources
either manually via portal 
or
using automated ways using api's and scripting
but regarads what choices you make in both cases there is time between request is submitted and response is delivered
therefore Agility is the ability to allocate and deallocate resources quickly

Fault Tolerance
It is the ability to remain up and running during component and services failure
Disasters is a serious disruption of services caused by natural or human-induced causes
Disaster recovery--it simply means creating two copy of the same application in two different azure regions.
High Availability --it is a measure of system uptime of users/services
High Availability is the ability to keep services running for extended periods of time with very little downtime

Brief
Cloud Computing
Service delivery model over the internet (cloud). This includes but is not limited to

compute power meaning servers such as windows, linux, hosting environments, etc.
storage like files and/or databases
networking in azure but also outside when connecting to your company network
analytics services for visualization and telemetry data
Key concepts
scalability is the ability to scale, so allocate and deallocate resources at any time
elasticity is the ability to scale dynamically
agility is the ability to react fast (scale quickly)
fault tolerance is the ability to maintain system uptime while physical and service component failures happen
disaster recovery is the process and design principle which allows a system to recovers from natural or human induced disasters
high availability is the agreed level of operational uptime for the system. It is a simple calculation of system uptime versus whole lifetime of the system.
availability = uptime/(uptime + downtime)
