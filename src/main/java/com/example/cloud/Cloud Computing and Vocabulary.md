Describe what is cloud computing: a delivery model for services like

- Storage (files, databases)
- Compute Power
- Networking
- Analytics
- More services.
  Compute Power
  Once data is in cloud you need compute power resources like(windows vm,linux,web containers,.or any other)
  Once you have your compute power you need to connect them securely.

Describe terms such as
.High Availability
.Scalability
.Elasticity
.Agility
.Fault Tolerance
.Disaster Recovery

Scalability
Scalability is the ability to scale
Scaling is a process of

+ allocating(adding) or
+ deallocating(removing)
+ resources

<img width="1397" alt="scalibility" src="https://github.com/PranayDange/OneMoreTime/assets/96629581/a8a96566-701b-4a43-bb5f-df4f0b3d661f">


Elasticity

+ Elasticity is the ability to scale dynamically
+ User load changes as the day changes

  <img width="1416" alt="elasticity" src="https://github.com/PranayDange/OneMoreTime/assets/96629581/53e9d7cc-2fe9-474b-a89e-4b796604cae7">

Agility
Agility the ability to reach quickly
In cloud there are two provisions the resources
either manually via portal
or
using automated ways using api's and scripting
but regarads what choices you make in both cases there is time between request is submitted and response is delivered
therefore Agility is the ability to allocate and deallocate resources quickly

Fault Tolerance
It is the ability to remain up and running during component and services failure
Disasters is a serious disruption of services caused by natural or human-induced causes
Disaster recovery--it simply means creating two copy of the same application in two different azure regions.
High Availability --it is a measure of system uptime of users/services
High Availability is the ability to keep services running for extended periods of time with very little downtime

<img width="1403" alt="high availability" src="https://github.com/PranayDange/OneMoreTime/assets/96629581/c45b8623-75af-43e3-b699-065c771473ea">

Brief
Cloud Computing
Service delivery model over the internet (cloud). This includes but is not limited to

compute power meaning servers such as windows, linux, hosting environments, etc.
storage like files and/or databases
networking in azure but also outside when connecting to your company network
analytics services for visualization and telemetry data
Key concepts
scalability is the ability to scale, so allocate and deallocate resources at any time
elasticity is the ability to scale dynamically
agility is the ability to react fast (scale quickly)
fault tolerance is the ability to maintain system uptime while physical and service component failures happen
disaster recovery is the process and design principle which allows a system to recovers from natural or human induced
disasters
high availability is the agreed level of operational uptime for the system. It is a simple calculation of system uptime
versus whole lifetime of the system.
availability = uptime/(uptime + downtime)

Geographies, Regions & Availability Zones

+ Describe Data Center --databases(mysql),web hosting,or virtual machine or one of many services in azure all these
  services run under physical
  services underneath(server) a physical facility that holds servers is data center
  Physical Facility,Hosting for group of networked servers
  A typical data center has its own power cooling and network infrastructure
   <img width="1404" alt="datacenter" src="https://github.com/PranayDange/OneMoreTime/assets/96629581/d5d6457f-e106-4e8b-9306-e06ad9a1192b"> 
+ Describe Regions -- A group of data centers that are connected with each other with high throughput internet
  connectivity are called regions(regions can be single data center or multiple one and they are globally distributed)
  Region is simply geographical area on the planet
  one but usually more datacenters connected with low-latency-network(<2milliseconds)


  <img width="1379" alt="Region1" src="https://github.com/PranayDange/OneMoreTime/assets/96629581/eef631a4-2774-40df-a7d8-cdad9cf263c1">

+ And Regions Pair -- regions are paired if the whole region goes down..the region that is paired with the region that will go up
 <img width="1440" alt="Region pair" src="https://github.com/PranayDange/OneMoreTime/assets/96629581/fd3707c6-ee5f-44e2-b95b-2bae6d50bce8">

+ Describe Availability Zones --Grouping of physically separate facility,Designed to protect from data center facilities
  if zone gets down others continue working
this creates replicate services

+ Describe Geographies -- all region and region pairs are grouped into Geographies
  Typically contains two or more regions
  
+ Describe Benefits and usage of core architectural components

- Virtual Machines Scale Sets
1) Infrastructure as a service(Iaas)
2) set of identical virtual machines
3) Built in autoscaling features
4) designed for manual and auto scaling workloads like web services,batch processing etc
 <img width="1440" alt="vm scale sets" src="https://github.com/PranayDange/OneMoreTime/assets/96629581/2fa90993-286a-42ec-a4b7-2116bf4cf140">

- Containers
1) use host's operating system
2) Emulate operating system (Virtual Machine emulate hardware)
3) Lightweight (no o/s)
