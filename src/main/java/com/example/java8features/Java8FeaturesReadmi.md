Que.What is the purpose of Java 8?

1. Concise and minimal code
2. We are missing functional programming benefits in OOPS nature.To utilize functional programming benefits in java java
   8 has come but still it is OOP language.
3. To enable parallel programming more compatible code for multi core processors.

Que. Java 8 features?
Lambda Expression --it is an anonymous function
Stream API
Date And Time API
Base64 Encode and Decode
Method Reference and Constructor Reference
Default methods in interfaces
Static methods in interfaces
Functional interface
Optional Class
Java IO Improvements
Collection API Improvements

Que.What is lambda expression?
Lambda expression is am anonymous function i.,e
not having any name
not having any return type
not having modifier

steps to make any function lambda expression

1. Remove modifier
2. Remove return type
3. Remove method name
4. place arrow

Type Inference -- Compiler will itself understand the type of the argument

Benefits of Lambda Expression:

1. To enable functional programming in java
2. To make code more readable, maintainable and concise code
3. To enable parallel processing
4. JAR file size reduction
5. Elimination of shadow variables

Que.What is Functional Interface?
Interface having exactly single abstract method but can have any number of defaults and static methods.
we can invoke lambda expression by using functional interface.

Que.What is Default methods inside an interface?
the methods which comes with the body are called default methods

Que.What is static methods inside an interface?
Ans.Static methods in interface are those methods which are defined in the interface with the keyword static
static methods contain the complete definition of the function
cannot be overridden or changed in the implementation class.
