Why Recursion??

recursion is actually function calling itself
this are function call linked to one another



we need recursion because it helps us in solving bigger/complex problem in simpler way
you can convert recursion solution into iteration and vice-versa
it helps us in breaking down bigger problems into smaller problems


convert recursion to iteration
and
iteration to recursion


space complexity is not constant  because of recursive calls



visualizing recursion
