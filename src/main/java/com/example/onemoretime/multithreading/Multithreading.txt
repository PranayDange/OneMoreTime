    //Multithreading in java is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously
    //multithreading is done for multi tasking
    //to acheive multitasking multi threading is done


    // a thread is a lightweight sub-process the smallest unit of processing


    //creating thread in java
    //using Runnable interface
    //using Thread class


    //using Runnable interface
    /*interface Runnable{
        run();
    }*/
    //example of Runnable Interface
   /* class MyThread implements Runnable{

        @Override
        public void run() {
            //task
        }
    }
    MyThread t = new MyThread();
    Thread thread = new Thread(t);
    thread.start();*/

    //using Thread class
    /*class Thread extends Thread {
        }*/
    //example of thread class
   /* class MyThread extends Thread{
        @Override
        public void run() {
            //task
        }
    }
    //MyThread t = new MyThread();
    t.start();*/

    //some thread methods are :-
    1.run()
    2.start()
    3.sleep()
    4.join()
    5.interrupt()
    6.resume()
    7.stop()
