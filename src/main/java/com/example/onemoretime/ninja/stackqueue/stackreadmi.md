Suppose we have 10 chairs(numbered 1 to 10 from top to bottom) placed on top of each other, 
now we remove the top 5 chairs and from the remaining 5 ,we again remove 2 chairs and place the previous 5 chairs back. 
Which numbered chair is at 6th position from the bottom?
answer=3


What method is used in implementation of stacks?
Ans --Last in first out



Given an empty Stack and we perform following functions on the stack:

1. push(5)
2. push(3)
3. push(4)
4. pop()
   5 push(2)
   What is the size of stack now?


Problem statement
What would be the sum of elements of Stack after performing following functions:

1. push(5)
2. push(3)
3. push(4)
4. pop()
5. push(2)

What should be the return type of size function in stack?
Ans-- int

Which of the following operation take worst case i.e. linear time (O(n)) in the array implementation of stack?
Ans-- 



Consider the following pseudo-code that uses a Stack:

declare a stack of characters
while ( there are more characters in the word to read )
{
read a character
push the character on the stack
}
while ( the stack is not empty )
{
pop a character off the stack
write the character to the screen
}

What would be the output of the following code?

import java.util.Stack;
class Test {
public static void main (String[] args) {
Stack<Integer> stack=new Stack<Integer>();
stack.push(5);
stack.push(10);
stack.push(15);
System.out.print(stack.pop()+stack.size());
}
}
