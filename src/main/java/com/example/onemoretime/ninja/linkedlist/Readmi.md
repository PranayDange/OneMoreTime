8.Print a linked list using recursion

Which scenario is best suited for linked lists?
Ans-- Managing Data structure with constantly changing sizes.

Solution Description
Linked Lists provide efficient dynamic memory allocation.making them well suited for situations
where the size of the data structure needs to be constantly changing.This is because linked lists
allow for the efficient insertion and delection of elements at any position within the list
without requiring the entire structure to be resized or moved.
