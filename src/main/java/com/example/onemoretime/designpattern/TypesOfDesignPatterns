Design patterns are reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design.
They provide a structured approach to solving design problems and help in creating software systems that are flexible, modular, and maintainable.
Design patterns capture the knowledge and experience of seasoned developers and provide guidelines for designing software architectures.

There are several categories of design patterns, including:
Creational Patterns: These patterns focus on object creation mechanisms, providing ways to create objects in a flexible and decoupled manner.
Examples include the Singleton, Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, and Prototype patterns.


Structural Patterns: Structural patterns deal with the composition of classes and objects to form larger structures while keeping them flexible and efficient.
Some commonly used structural patterns include Adapter, Composite, Decorator, Facade, and Proxy.


Behavioral Patterns: Behavioral patterns focus on the interaction and communication between objects, defining how they work together to fulfill specific responsibilities.
Examples of behavioral patterns include Observer, Strategy, Command, Iterator, and Template Method.


Architectural Patterns: These patterns provide higher-level guidelines for organizing the overall structure of a software system.
They define the relationships and interactions between various components of the system.
Common architectural patterns include Model-View-Controller (MVC), Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM), Layered Architecture, and Microservices.



Concurrency Patterns: Concurrency patterns address challenges related to designing and managing concurrent and parallel execution in software systems.
Examples include Thread Pool, Producer-Consumer, Read-Write Lock, and Barrier.
