Factory design pattern or factory method design pattern



when there is superclass and multiple subclasses and we want to get object of subclass based on input and requirement
then we create factory class which takes the responsibility of creating object of class based on input

advantages of factory design patter
1. focuses on creating object for interface rather than implementation
2.loose coupling, more robust code
