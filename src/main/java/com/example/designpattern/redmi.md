---------
1. HLD and LLD (High level design and low level design)

---------
There are three types of design pattern
1. Creational: Focuses on encapsulating the object creation process.
2. Structural: Deals with the composition of classes and objects to form larger structures.
3. Behavioral: Concerned with the interaction and responsibility distribution between objects.

1. Creational Patterns
Focus: How objects are created.
Example: Imagine you are building different types of toys.
Factory Pattern: Instead of manually creating each toy, you have a factory that creates toys for you. 
You tell the factory what type of toy you want (e.g., car, doll), and it makes one for you.

2. Structural Patterns
Focus: How objects and classes are combined to form larger structures.
Example: Connecting different types of plugs and sockets with an adapter.
Imagine you have an old plug that doesn't fit into a modern socket. You need an adapter to connect them.
   Adapter Pattern
   Problem: You have a round plug but a square socket. They don't fit together.
   Solution: Use an adapter that allows the round plug to connect to the square socket.
   Objects -->
   RoundPlug: An old plug with a round shape.
   SquareSocket: A new socket with a square shape.
   Adapter: A device that connects the round plug to the square socket.

3. Behavioral Patterns
Focus: How objects interact and share responsibilities.
Example: A school classroom where students ask the teacher questions.
Observer Pattern: Imagine you are a student, and you want to know when the teacher posts new assignments. 
You (the observer) will be notified whenever there is a new assignment.
